# CoolFolio

This is my portfolio website that i made with [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) & [Tailwinds Css](https://tailwindcss.com/), all the rendered data is fetched from the `/src/builder.js` file. Edit this file to change the contents of the website.

## Themes

- `brew` - Blue
- `royal` - Orange
- `valencia` - Red
- `emerald` - Green
- `amethyst` - Pink

## Customization

As said above, you can customize the website with `builder.js` file in the `/src/`.
